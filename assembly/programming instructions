This is very rough, and I would love to make it smoother, but let's see if we can walk before we run. Read the whole set of instructions first, as the transition from 3->4 must occur in less than 10 seconds.

0) Plug in the board.
1) Locate .hex file. (Result of compiling.)
2) Download and install avrdude: http://www.nongnu.org/avrdude/
3) Send a 'P' to the board.
  a) You can do this from the command line in linux.
       First set the baud rate: stty baud=1000000 -F /dev/ttyUSB0 . Sometimes you have to do this twice.
       Then send the character: echo P > /dev/ttyUSB0
  b) I can't seem to make echoing to the COM port work in Windows. It's easy enough just to use realterm or cygwin to do this.
4) After sending 'P', you have 10 seconds to have avrdude program the device with the command:
"avrdude -U flash:w:<file.hex> -c avr109 -b 1000000 -p m168 -P /dev/ttyUSB0 -v -v"
You can probably guess what most of the parameters do. Let me know if you have questions.

5) Check the status of avrdude and make sure it was successful.
