Crystal frequency monitoring app. Install through serial port (with AVRDUDE) after bootloader.

We had some assembly problems in the v1.0 batch, and this was written to test the crystal. It's not a very good test of crystal frequency, as it's using the ATmega168's internal 8MHz oscillator as the baseline. It's more of a test of crystal operation.
